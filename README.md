# Vue3 Exercises

Exercise 1: A view that displays a list of all the artists that have been created, with functionality to add, edit, or delete an artist. A view that displays all the albums, with functionality to add, edit, or delete an album. In the section for adding or editing an album, there should be a dropdown that lists all the artists that have been added in the other view. All data must be stored in memory using Pinia.


## Improvements
- Exercise 1 is not done well. Make reusable components for displaying the data and getting the data
- Use what was learned in exercise 2 to imrpove exercise 1 
- Better validation in exercise 1 fields
